Only look at pills.rb, since the rest are just scratch files.

To run, you should have ruby installed, along with sqlite3 driver.

You have options to add, update, and delete any number of pills, and for each pill you can track the name, amount to take, and how often you have to take it -- most of the time, it will be once a day.

Then, you can easily check whether you've taken your pills for the day or not, and update the pills log automagically.
